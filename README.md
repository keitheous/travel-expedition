## Techical Requirements

As a group project, it is our aim to produce a single page application website using numerous  technical skills such as **asynchronous loading**, **AJAX** calls and **JQuery**. This website also utilises two external (currency conversion & emergency contact )and 1 internal **APIs**, as well as contains **standard user profile flow** which allows users to Create, View, Update and Delete (CRUD) their profile. In addition to that, Users can add cards of a desired travel destination to this bookmarking-bucketlisting-app based on categories and sort by tags. 


## Stack

Ruby on Rails 
JQuery for GUI
Ajax for API calls
Handlebars.js for templating
Bootstrap 

## APIs

- Emergency Number API
- Currency Exchange API
- Internal Database API

## The Problem

There are many booking marking apps out there, but when it comes to travel, we don't want to trawl through 100's of baking recipies and fitspo pictures. Travellers are passionate, always seeking information, looking out for tips and secrets. But the information gets lost. Scraps of paper get washed.

##Our Solution

We offer a dedicated travel bookmarking list that you use daily while at home, and can sort and view your dream places quickly while you are abroad.
